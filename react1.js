//what is react.js ?
//js library-> UI(fronted),META facebook(2013)

//why we need ract.js (in old time in facbook app example if we get any msg or frnd request count is not updated)
//so for that we need render or reload whole page .
// whts why component based architecture in this everything is component in react.js
//in this everything is divide into component only that part will reload and not other component will not reload

var h1 = document.createElement(h1);
h1.innerHTML = "hello form js"
document.body.appendChild(h1) //to access the body element
